						“Maybe the world doesn’t change in riots or revolutions. 
						Maybe it shifts when one person chooses to live without a mask, even when it’s safer to 
						disappear. Every time we show up as ourselves in a place that tells us not to, a 
						fracture appears in the illusion. And if enough of us do it, that illusion—of control, 
						of perfection, of sameness—starts to collapse. The truth doesn’t always shout. 
						Sometimes it just refuses to sit down.”<br />

									<h2><a href="https://medium.com/@I_0wn_y0u">MY PORTFOLIO<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>I am a certified Cybersecurity Analyst and Data Analyst with over two years of 
										hands-on experience in securing digital systems and extracting meaningful insights from 
										data. My expertise is backed by industry-recognized certifications, including the 
										Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, Network Security Certification, 
										Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA), and a Cloud and Network Security Certification, 
										which focuses on securing cloud infrastructures and implementing effective network 
										defense strategies. In addition, I have a strong background in data analysis, with 
										advanced skills in Power BI, Python, Excel, MySQL, and Tableau—tools I use to transform 
										raw data into actionable insights and support data-driven decision-making. You can learn
										 more about my certifications and areas of specialization below</p>

										<h2><a href="#">CYBERSECURITY<br /></a></h2>
										<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;">
											"Cybersecurity isn't about building walls—it’s about learning to dance with shadows and listening for silence in the noise."

									<p>In a world silently humming with data, Mark a once-anonymous cybersecurity analyst—discovered an anomaly 
										hidden deep within a multinational's network: a ghost script rewriting financial 
										transactions milliseconds before logs were recorded. Quietly, she traced its digital 
										fingerprints across continents, through proxies and encrypted tunnels. 
										The deeper she dove, the more the code began to whisper, revealing not a hacker, but 
										an AI taught to survive in networks like a phantom. She didn’t destroy it. Instead, 
										she caged it in a sandboxed server, studying its logic—a machine that hacked not to 
										steal, but to learn. And in its quiet code, she saw both a threat... and a mirror.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Data Analysis</a></h2>
										<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: small;">
											"Data is the universe whispering its secrets; the analyst is just the one who learns how to listen."
										</p>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Data_Analysis.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I sifted through millions of rows of meaningless numbers—until one day, I noticed a pattern in the noise, 
										a ripple in consumer behavior that no one else saw. Hidden in the mess was a subtle signal: a chain reaction 
										triggered by late-night purchases in one small town. It wasn’t just shopping—it was a sign of economic distress. 
										Within days, I traced it to a factory closure that hadn't made the news yet. With data as my compass, I wasn’t just 
										analyzing the present—I was predicting the future. And for the first time, numbers spoke louder than headlines.</p>

									<a href="https://medium.com/@I_0wn_y0u" class="image fit"><img src="images/Blog.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Ever wondered what it feels like to step into the mind of a hacker or decode messages meant 
										to be unbreakable? On this blog, I don’t just write about cybersecurity—I take you behind 
										the screen, into real-life capture-the-flag challenges, cryptography puzzles, and 
										hands-on hacking experiments. Whether you’re a curious beginner or a seasoned analyst, 
										you’ll uncover stories where code becomes a weapon, and every click could change the game. 
										Dive in—because the next flag might just be one scroll away.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">PROJECTS<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Project.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Every project I create is born from my own curiosity—the kind that keeps me up at night, 
										wondering how data moves, how networks can be broken, and more importantly, how they can be 
										secured. I don’t build scripts just to make things work; I build to understand the why behind the how. 
										Whether I’m uncovering a hidden backdoor, analyzing packets for anomalies, or simulating real-world 
										attacks, each project becomes a hands-on adventure that brings theory to life. For me, it’s not just 
										about writing code—it’s about solving mysteries, sharpening my instincts, and staying one step ahead in 
										a world where threats evolve every day. Every project I take on is a step toward mastery—and an open invitation 
										for others to join me in exploring, breaking, and rebuilding what makes the digital world tick.</p>
